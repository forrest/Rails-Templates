Rails Templates
=======

This is the first of several Rails application templates that I plan to make. I used a lot of code from various RailsCasts with Ryan Bates, and the www.binarylogic.com blog which produces the AuthLogic gem. These have both been great resources and I recommend you check them out.

NOTE: I decided I wanted this all in a single file, rather than splitting the code into numerous generators. I realize it makes for ugly code. If you know a way to have multiple files in a template without resorting to generators, I would love to hear it.
